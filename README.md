Bus is one of the most important medium of transport as it is the optimal solution in
the trade-off between number of passengers and number of available destinations. Moreover,
managing are the core of transportation vehicle management as companies want to ensure
about ownership of the seat properly. Making this system online both brings consistency
and easiness at the management. In this project, you are expected to create a system that
handles seats of the buses with giving options as creating/cancelling a bus voyage, selling and
refunding available seats, and taking a view to voyages.
